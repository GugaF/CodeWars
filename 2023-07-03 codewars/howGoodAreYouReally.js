// 8 Kyu - How good are you really?
// There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
// But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.

// You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!

// Return True if you're better, else False!
// Note:

// Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!

    classPoints.push(yourPoints)  
    const sum = classPoints.reduce(( a , b ) => a + b , 0)
    return (sum / classPoints.length) <= yourPoints
}
